# Mac/Windows

## Installing `R`

1.  Go to the [CRAN website](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) and click on the appropriate link under "Download and Install R". Then:
    i.  **Windows**: click on the blue text that says "Install R for the first time".
    ii. **macOS**: check your Mac OS system and if you have a chip (Apple icon -\> About this Mac -\> Overview)
        i.  Then on the website, click the newest release that supports your current OS version. This will most likely be R-4.4.1-arm64.pkg or R-4.4.1-x86_64.pkg.

2.  Under **Step 2**, click the blue Download RStudio Desktop button recommended for your computer
    a.  **macOS** users: double check you have an OS that is recent enough! If not, find an older version of RStudio suitable for you OS.
3.  Run the downloaded RStudio Executable file until you hit the "Finish" button. It may be the case that you don't have to click anything at all.
