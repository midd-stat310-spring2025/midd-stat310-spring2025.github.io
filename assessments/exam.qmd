## **Quiz 1**

Friday, 2/28 from 2:30-3:30pm in WNS 101.

-   Content through end of Week 2 is fair game (but no coding will be on the quiz)

-   No note sheets allowed

-   Study tips:

    -   Review notes and homework, do the extra practice problems associated with each class

    -   Really ask yourself if you understand each step of a solution (this is humbling, but oh so important)

    -   Seek assistance *after* trying problems on your own. Part of the battle is learning for yourself how to translate problem set-up into mathematical notation.

-   Extra practice problems [here](quiz1_practice_probs.pdf) (solutions posted sometime early Thursday)

    -   2/27: Note, problem 7 on the Quiz 1 practice problems had a poor set-up. I've updated the problem!
