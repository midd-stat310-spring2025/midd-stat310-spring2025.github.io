## Quiz 2

Friday, 4/25 **in class (8:30am start)**.

-   Content after midterm through Wednesday 4/16 is fair game (continuous stuff through joint distributions and 2D-LoTUS)

-   Expect it to be similar to Quiz 1 in length/difficulty

-   You will be provided [this distribution sheet](distributions_310.pdf) containing all the named distributions we've learned thus far. There are some distributions that we have not yet learned as well.

    -   Note, it does not contain MGFs!

-   You are allowed one, single-sided note sheet (8.5x11 inches)

    -   Your note sheet cannot include any worked out examples/derivations

-   Practice problems [here](quiz2_practice_probs.pdf)

## **Midterm**

### What and when

-   Thursday, April 3 from 7:00-9:00pm in WNS 105
-   Content through March 26 is fair game (emphasis on content from Week 3 onward)
-   You are allowed one, single-sided note sheet (8.5x11 inches)
    -   Your note sheet cannot include any worked out examples/derivations
    -   I **highly recommend** you write out the PMFs (including supports), means, and variances for our named distributions. Some of them will most likely appear on the midterm and I will not provide their PMFs for you.
-   No homework due Week 7, but there will be a problem set due the following Tuesday (4/8)

### Study tips

-   Review notes and homework, do the extra practice problems associated with each class
-   Extra practice problems [here](midterm_practice_probs.pdf) (solutions shared on Canvas)
-   Come to office hours!!
-   My personal working strategy:
    1.  First review your notes
    2.  Make a first draft of your note sheet, then do some practice problems using only your note sheet to see if what you wrote on it is actually useful for you
    3.  Make a new note sheet
    4.  Repeat as necessary

## **Quiz 1**

Friday, 2/28 from 2:30-3:30pm in WNS 101.

-   Content through end of Week 2 is fair game (but no coding will be on the quiz)

-   No note sheets allowed

-   Study tips:

    -   Review notes and homework, do the extra practice problems associated with each class

    -   Really ask yourself if you understand each step of a solution (this is humbling, but oh so important)

    -   Seek assistance *after* trying problems on your own. Part of the battle is learning for yourself how to translate problem set-up into mathematical notation.

-   Extra practice problems [here](quiz1_practice_probs.pdf) (solutions posted sometime early Thursday)

    -   2/27: Note, problem 7 on the Quiz 1 practice problems had a poor set-up. I've updated the problem!
